# MY C JOURNEY
## A collection of sample / example programs, I wrote to learn C and networking
Some are not purely written by me, rather inspired from other's examples

Till this commit, all examples are purely written in `C` Language %NOT IN C PLUS PLUS%, and all examples use `gcc` binary to compile.

## Collection

* `my-lib` - A library containg shared functionality amoung differnt examples
    * `make` this before `make`ing any other project, as that may depend on it

* `temp-files` - Example to use temporary files in programs


> I'm sorry if programs are not documented well.
